During the course of the looting, incidents of significant harm to civilians occurred from the stampede and people being run over by the trucks. In addition, during the incidents of crowding, dozens of Gazans advanced towards nearby IDF troops, up to several meters from them, and thereby posed a real threat to the forces at that point. At this stage, the forces fired cautionary fire in order to distance the suspects. As the suspects continued to advance toward them, the troops fired precisely toward a number of the suspects to remove the threat.The incident will continue to be examined by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism (FFAM)- an independent examination body, responsible for examining exceptional incident that occurred during the fighting. The FFAM will independently examine the incident and the findings, and will formulate its conclusions regarding the incident.The IDF places great importance to the humanitarian efforts, and makes many efforts to facilitate humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and to improve the existing mechanisms.Attached is an infographic that displays the sequence of events:https://IDFANC.activetrail.biz/anc08032024685454215421Attached is an infographic that displays the locations of IDF troops during the incident:https://IDFANC.activetrail.biz/anc0703202468546845","['Northern Gaza Strip', 'the', 'northern Gaza Strip', 'Gaza', 'Gaza Strip']","['Yaron Finkelman', 'Herzi Halevi']","['Southern', 'ID', 'FFAM', 'IDF']",0

Investigations revealed information about the current activities ofMunir Makdah, a resident of Ain al-Hilweh in Lebanon who is of Palestinian descent, known for years as an operative of both Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard,and continues to attempt to carry out attacks.In the investigations of the involved parties and the ISA's long-term operations, it emerged that Munir Makdah is recruiting agents in Judea and Samaria to carry out attacks and advance the smuggling of Iranian weaponry and funding to terrorist cells in Judea and Samaria through various channels.As part of the ISA operation against Munir Makdah, a significant amount of advanced weapons that had been smuggled into Judea and Samaria were seized.The ISA and IDF are working to locate and thwart the smuggling of Iranian arms into Judea and Samaria and to neutralize the terrorist cells recruited by Iranian agents. Additionally, the ISA will continue operating against those recruited for security activities throughout the State of Israel.The ISA, in cooperation with other security branches, views with great severity the involvement in security activities directed by Iran and its proxies and will continue to take active measures to monitor and thwart any activity that endangers the security of Israeli civilians and the State of Israel. The ISA will expose and target Iranian efforts to carry out terror activities within Israel and will take action to bring the involved parties to justice.Details about the arms seized in the operation against Munir Makdah:* 2 BTB15 peripheral shrapnel charges* 5 Iranian anti-tank mines model YM-2 and 5 detonators* 4 M203 grenade launchers* 15 kg of C4 explosives* 10 kg of Semtex explosives* 13 shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles* 15 RPG launchers* 16 RPG-7 rockets + explosives* 25 hand grenades* 33 M4 rifles* 50 pistolsAttached is footage of the Iranian weapons seized by the ISA and IDF (Credit: ISA Spokesperson):https://bit.ly/3VBaUj9Attached are pictures of the seized weapons, 2 peripheral shrapnel charges, and 5 anti-tank mines (Credit: ISA Spokesperson):https://IDFANC.activetrail.biz/ANC250320247628742389Attached is a picture of Jawad Rafari:https://IDFANC.activetrail.biz/ANC2503202472387585498Attached is a picture of Munir Makdah:https://IDFANC.activetrail.biz/ANC25032024249874225","['Iran', 'Judea', 'SamariaI', 'Iran', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Israel', 'Syrian Soil', 'Ain al - Hilweh', 'Lebanon', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Israel']","['Jawad Rafari', 'Asghar Bakhari', '##M', '##uni', '##r Makdah', 'Munir Makdah', 'Munir Ma']","['ISA', 'IDF', 'ISA', 'IDF', 'Special Operations Department of the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guard', 'IRGC', 'Quds Force', '18840', 'ISA', 'IDF', 'Hezbollah', 'Iranian Revolutionary Guard', 'ISA', 'ISA', 'ISA', 'IDF', 'ISA', 'ISA', 'ISA']",0

The examination was carried out based on the videos of the strike from the combat helicopter fighting in the area at the same time, the UAV, the security cameras of Kibbutz Nir Oz, and based on the testimonies of the aerial crews that operated in the area, as well as the family members of Efrat Katz z”l and other witnesses who were there at the time of the incident.On the 7th of October, the IDF failed its mission to protect civilians and went to war. During the surprise attack, Hamas and other terrorist organizations invaded several Israeli communities, murdering both Israeli and foreign citizens.From the findings of the examination, it appears that during the battles and the airstrikes, one of the combat helicopters that took part in the fighting, fired at a vehicle that had terrorists in it, and which, in retrospect, based on the testimonies, also had hostages in it.As a result of the fire, most of the terrorists manning the vehicle were killed, and most likely, Efrat Katz z”l was killed as well.The conclusions of the examination team stated that as long as Israeli hostages were present in the moving vehicle, they could not be distinguished by the existing surveillance systems, and the shooting was defined as shooting at a vehicle with terrorists.Commanding Officer of the Israeli Air Force, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, summarized the findings of the incident and emphasized that the IAF carried out an honest and transparent examination, out of a deep commitment to the bereaved family and the families of the hostages.He also received the results of the team's examination while noting that the findings refer to the IAF's part in this incident.This is a tragic and unfortunate event that took place in the midst of fighting and conditions of uncertainty. The commander of the air force did not find fault in the operation by the helicopter crew, who operated in compliance with the orders in a complex reality of war.The findings of the examination team were presented to the bereaved family and to the families of the hostages. The IDF shares in the grief of the Katz family and the Nir Oz community.Along with the continuation of the war, the IDF continues to examine the events of the 7th of October, including the events in Nir Oz. When complete, the findings will be presented transparently to the public.","['Kibbutz Nir Oz', 'Kibbutz Nir Oz', 'Kibbutz Nir Oz']","['E', '##frat Katz', 'Efrat Katz', 'E', '##frat Katz', 'E', '##frat Katz', 'Tomer Bar']","['Israeli Air Force', 'IAF', 'Hamas', 'Israeli Air Force', 'IDF', 'Hamas', 'Israeli Air Force', 'IAF']",0

During the activity, 3 offensive terror tunnels, that were under intelligence and technological surveillance by the IDF over recent years, were located. Following preliminary ground activity they were mapped and destroyed. The operation was carried out by the Southern Command's Engineering Array, the Gaza Division, the 98th Division and the Yahalom Unit.One of the tunnels was uncovered about a decade ago, and in 2021 during the ""Guardian of the Walls"" operation it was struck from the air, resulting in the elimination of several Hamas terrorists. At the beginning of the current war it was struck at several points to prevent offensive activity, and over the last weeks it was destroyed by engineering forces.Another tunnel was uncovered in 2014 as a terror tunnel crossing into Israeli territory and was destroyed. The Hamas terrorist organization did not restore the tunnel since then, and in recent weeks another section of the tunnel deep inside the Gaza Strip, was destroyed.The third tunnel that was destroyed in the last few weeks, was uncovered in 2019, before the construction of the underground barrier, when one branch of the tunnel crossed a few hundred meters into Israeli territory.

In this branch of the tunnel, IDF soldiers placed traps and sensors for the IDF to use if needed, as part of the IDF's activity against the Hamas terrorist organization’s underground network of tunnels.
